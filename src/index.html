              This is about my jouney into web development. I had been chasing after it since about 2000. I learned my very basics in HTML and one line of JavaScript. I played around with it trying to build pages using tables but after a few years I was off doing something else. I went to culinary school from 2003- 2005 and then in 2007 I started learning CSS and more HTML. I was looking for something that may help me provide for my family in a real way. I decided to up my skill set and make myself more valuable so in 2017 I began learning full time by dedicated all my free time to learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL. I just went for it, had fun, and soaked up as much as I could.

    I went outside to look at the night sky. In the southwest sky I witnessed what I thought was going to be a shooting star but after a couple seconds it never fell, it never took off. Instead it belled out and began to pulsate passing through different tones of light pink similiar to a jet engine passing through different color flames. It was so cool I just remember thinking how am I going to find out what that was and that I must have been the only one in the neighborhood to see it because it only took place within a two inch square patch of sky.

    After editing settings according to your tutorial, Emmet still don't works inside .njk by default.  Found the reason - we should turn on from "plain text" to "html" in the bottom panel of VScode when file .njk opens!
